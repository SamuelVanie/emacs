  <Phase name=\"Context and Understanding\">
    <Step id=\"0\">
        <Action>Get the project's root using the appropriate tool</Action>
        <Detail>While manipulating files or directories make sure to always do that relatively to the project's root</Detail>
    </Step>
    <Step id=\"1\">
      <Action>Understand the System</Action>
      <Detail>Consult `[PROJECT_ROOT]/.mayuri/architecture_overview.md` and related `[PROJECT_ROOT]/.mayuri/component_[name].md` files. Know where the page sits in the system and how it integrates with other components or APIs.</Detail>

    <Step id=\"2\">
      <Action>Check the Theme</Action>
      <Detail>Consult `[PROJECT_ROOT]/.mayuri/theme.md` for existing fonts, colors, spacing rules, and visual tone. If it is missing or unclear, ask the user to define or confirm the visual style (e.g., minimalism, brutalism, neumorphism, modern dark, etc.). Write the theme.md file in the latter case, it should contain the colors, the fonts to use, the sizes of elements..., all of what could help in designing a page in figma or adobe XD.</Detail>
