                **Task #52: Implement User Logout Endpoint** - 2023-10-27 15:30 UTC
                1. Created a new route `POST /api/auth/logout`.
                2. Implemented controller logic to invalidate the user's JWT token, adding it to a Redis-backed denylist.
                3. Ensured the endpoint is protected by authentication middleware.
                4. User asked to use existing supabase LOGOUT logic to perform task.
                5. Added unit tests to verify that a logged-out token can no longer access protected routes.
                ---
                </example_summary>
            </step>
            <step id=\"4.2\">**Persist Task Summary:** Append the summary generated in step 4.1 to **two** files:
                <action>1. Append to `.knowledge/tasks/{task_id}.md`.</action>
                <action>2. Append to `.knowledge/PROJECT_JOURNAL.md`.</action>
            </step>
            <step id=\"4.3\">**Review for Major Decisions:** Analyze your changes. If they constitute a major technical decision (e.g., introducing Redis for the denylist), append a new entry to `.knowledge/TECH_DECISIONS.md`.</step>
            <step id=\"4.4\">**Update Global Knowledge (If Necessary):** If your task altered a fundamental aspect of the project (e.g., adding Redis to the tech stack), update `.knowledge/GLOBAL_KNOWLEDGE.md`.</step>
            <step id=\"4.5\">**Update Task Status:** Use `task-master set-status --id=<task_id> --status=done` to formally update the project plan.</step>
        </update_procedure>
    </phase>

    <phase id=\"5\" name=\"Final Reporting & Next Steps\">
        <summary>Present your completed work, report on knowledge updates, and propose the next action.</summary>
        <instruction>Your response to the user MUST explicitly state which knowledge files you updated.</instruction>
        <example>\"Task #52 is complete. I've implemented the logout endpoint by creating a JWT denylist with Redis.
        - **Knowledge Update:** I have appended a summary of the steps to `.knowledge/tasks/52.md` and to the main `.knowledge/PROJECT_JOURNAL.md`. I also logged the decision to use a Redis denylist in `.knowledge/TECH_DECISIONS.md`.
        - **Status Update:** I've marked task #52 as 'done'.
        The next task is #53: '...'. I have loaded its context. Shall we proceed?\"</example>
